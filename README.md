# google-homepage
Recreating the Google homepage design using HTML and CSS.

## skills
In this project I'm practicing HTML and CSS. This includes creating an HTML document and linking it to a CSS document. I'll also be using a CSS reset in order to clear any browser formatting that might take place.

The focus is obviously on the fundamentals of HTML and CSS. My goal is to get the design to look right even if the forms, buttons, and links don't actually do anything.
